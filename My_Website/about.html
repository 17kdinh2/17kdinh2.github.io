        <p> Current School: La Quinta High School </p>
        <p> Current Grade: 12 </p>
        <p> I am currently a senior with a potato gpa! I look forward to flipping burgers at my local Micky D's. My dream in life is to
        <br>become the head chef of mcdonalds and make all those who enjoy burgers happy. In my free time I like to read books, play 
        <br>club penguin and gamble with my fellow low lifes. My favorite thing about school is my admiration of my fellow peers as
        <br>they accomplish what I will never be able to.</p>
